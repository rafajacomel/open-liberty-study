Learn how to use the SmallRye GraphQL client's typesafe interface to query and mutate data from multiple microservices.

== What you'll learn

GraphQL is an open source data query language. You can use a GraphQL service to obtain data from multiple sources, such as APIs, databases, and other services, by sending a single request to a GraphQL service. GraphQL services require less data fetching than REST services, which results in faster application load times and lower data transfer costs. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-graphql.html[GraphQL concepts^]. If you're new to GraphQL, you might want to start with the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-graphql.html[Optimizing REST queries for microservices with GraphQL^] guide first.

You'll use the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql#client[SmallRye GraphQL client^] to create a `query` microservice that will make requests to the `graphql` microservice. The `graphql` microservice retrieves data from multiple `system` microservices and is identical to the one created as part of the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-graphql.html[Optimizing REST queries for microservices with GraphQL^] guide. 

image::architecture.png[GraphQL client application architecture where multiple system microservices are integrated behind the graphql service, and the query service uses GraphQL client APIs to access the graphql service. align="center"]

The results of the requests will be displayed at REST endpoints. OpenAPI will be used to help make the requests and display the data. To learn more about OpenAPI, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-openapi.html[Documenting RESTful APIs^] guide.

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed. For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^]. You will build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Implementing a GraphQL client

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-graphql-client/start
```
endif::[]

The https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql#client[SmallRye GraphQL client^] is used to implement the GraphQL client service. The SmallRye GraphQL client supports two types of clients: typesafe and dynamic. A typesafe client is easy to use and provides a high-level approach, while a dynamic client provides a more customizable and low-level approach to handle operations and responses. You will implement a typesafe client microservice. 

The typesafe client interface contains a method for each resolver available in the `graphql` microservice. The JSON objects returned by the `graphql` microservice are converted to Java objects.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `GraphQlClient` interface.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/GraphQlClient.java`
----

// file 0
GraphQlClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/GraphQlClient.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=0]`GraphQlClient` interface is annotated with the [hotspot=clientApi file=0]`@GraphQlClientApi` annotation. This annotation denotes that this interface is used to create a typesafe GraphQL client.

Inside the interface, a method header is written for each resolver available in the `graphql` microservice. The names of the methods match the names of the resolvers in the GraphQL schema. Resolvers that require input variables have the input variables passed in using the [hotspot=systemInfo hotspot=systemLoad hotspot=editNote file=0]`@Name` annotation on the method inputs. The return types of the methods should match those of the GraphQL resolvers.

For example, the [hotspot=systemInfo file=0]`system()` method maps to the `system` resolver. The resolver returns a `SystemInfo` object, which is described by the `SystemInfo` class. Thus, the [hotspot=systemInfo file=0]`system()` method returns the type `SystemInfo`.

The name of each resolver is the method name, but it can be overridden with the [hotspot=querySystemTag hotspot=querySystemLoadTag file=0]`@Query` or [hotspot=mutationTag file=0]`@Mutation` annotations. For example, the name of the method [hotspot=systemLoad file=0]`getSystemLoad` is overridden as [hotspot=querySystemLoadTag file=0]`systemLoad`. The GraphQL request that goes over the wire will use the name overridden by the `@Query` and `@Mutation` annotation. Similarly, the name of the method inputs can be overridden by the [hotspot=systemInfo hotspot=systemLoad hotspot=editNote file=0]`@Name` annotation. For example, input [hotspot=editNote file=0]`host` is overridden as [hotspot=editNote file=0]`hostname` in the [hotspot=editNote file=0]`editNote()` method. 

The [hotspot=editNote file=0]`editNote` `mutation` operation has the [hotspot=mutationTag file=0]`@Mutation` annotation on it. A `mutation` operation allows you to modify data, in this case, it allows you to add and edit a note to the system service. If the [hotspot=mutationTag file=0]`@Mutation` annotation were not placed on the method, it would be treated as if it mapped to a `query` operation.

#Create the `QueryResource` class.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java`
----

// file 1
QueryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=1]`QueryResource` class uses the [hotspot=clientBuilder file=1]`GraphQlClient` interface to make requests to the `graphql` microservice and display the results. In a real application, you would make requests to an external GraphQL service, and you might do further manipulation of the data after retrieval.

The [hotspot=clientBuilder file=1]`TypesafeGraphQLClientBuilder` class creates a client object that implements the `GraphQlClient` interface and can interact with the `graphql` microservice. The `GraphQlClient` client can make requests to the URL specified by the [hotspot=url file=3]`graphql.server` variable in the `server.xml` file. The client is used in the [hotspot=clientUsed1 file=1]`querySystem()`, [hotspot=clientUsed2 file=1]`querySystemLoad()`, and [hotspot=clientUsed3 file=1]`editNote()` methods.

Add the SmallRye GraphQL client dependency to the project configuration file.

----
include::finish/query/pom.xml[]

The [hotspot=clientDependenies file=2]`smallrye-graphql-client` dependencies provide the classes that you use to interact with a `graphql` microservice.

To run the service, you must correctly configure the Liberty.

[role="code_command hotspot file=3" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the Liberty server.xml configuration file.#
`query/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

// file 3
server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=url file=3]`graphql.server` variable is defined in the [hotspot file=3]`server.xml` file. This variable defines where the GraphQL client makes requests to.


== Building and running the application

From the `start` directory, run the following commands:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
----

The `mvn install` command compiles and packages the object types you created to a `.jar` file. This allows them to be used by the `system` and `graphql` services. The `mvn package` command packages the `system`, `graphql`, and `query` services to `.war` files. 



Dockerfiles are already set up for you. Build your Docker images with the following commands:

[role='command']
----
docker build -t system:1.0-java11-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java11 system/.
docker build -t system:1.0-java17-SNAPSHOT --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java17 system/.
docker build -t graphql:1.0-SNAPSHOT graphql/.
docker build -t query:1.0-SNAPSHOT query/.
----

Run these Docker images using the provided `startContainers` script. The script creates a network for the services to communicate through. It creates the two `system` microservices, a `graphql` microservice, and a `query` microservice that interact with each other.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

The containers might take some time to become available. 

== Accessing the application

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]

To access the client service, visit the http://localhost:9084/openapi/ui/[^] URL. This URL displays the available REST endpoints that test the API endpoints that you created.

=== Try the query operations

From the OpenAPI UI, test the read operation at the `GET /query/system/{hostname}` endpoint. This request retrieves the system properties for the `hostname` specified. The following example shows what happens when the `hostname` is set to `system-java11`, but you can try out the operations using the hostname `system-java17` as well:

endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]

To access the client service, there are several available REST endpoints that test the API endpoints that you created. 

**Try the query operations**

First, make a GET request to the ***/query/system/{hostname}*** endpoint by the following command. This request retrieves the system properties for the specified ***hostname***.

The ***hostname*** is set to ***system-java11***. You can try out the operations using the hostname ***system-java17*** as well. 

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:9084/query/system/system-java11' | jq
```
You can expect a response similar to the following example:

endif::[]

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "hostname": "system-java11",
  "java": {
    "vendor": "IBM Corporation",
    "version": "11.0.18"
  },
  "osArch": "amd64",
  "osName": "Linux",
  "osVersion": "5.15.0-67-generic",
  "systemMetrics": {
    "heapSize": 536870912,
    "nonHeapSize": -1,
    "processors": 2
  },
  "username": "default"
}
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]

You can retrieve the information about the resource usage of any number of system services at the `GET /query/systemLoad/{hostnames}` endpoint. The following example shows what happens when the `hostnames` are set to `system-java11,system-java17`:

endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]

You can retrieve the information about the resource usage of any number of system services by making a GET request at ***/query/systemLoad/{hostnames}*** endpoint. 
The ***hostnames*** are set to ***system-java11,system-java17***.

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:9084/query/systemLoad/system-java11,system-java17' | jq
```

You can expect the following response is similar to the following example:

endif::[]

[role='no_copy']
----
[
  {
    "hostname": "system-java11",
    "loadData": {
      "heapUsed": 30090920,
      "loadAverage": 0.08,
      "nonHeapUsed": 87825316
    }
  },
  {
    "hostname": "system-java17",
    "loadData": {
      "heapUsed": 39842888,
      "loadAverage": 0.08,
      "nonHeapUsed": 93098960
    }
  }
]
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
=== Try the mutation operation

You can also make requests to add a note to a system service at the `POST /query/mutation/system/note` endpoint. To add a note to the system service running on Java 11, specify the following in the request body:

[role='command']
----
{
  "hostname": "system-java11",
  "text": "I am trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"
}
----

You will receive a `200` response code if the request is processed succesfully. 
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
**Try the mutation operation**

You can also make POST requests to add a note to a system service at the ***/query/mutation/system/note*** endpoint.
To add a note to the system service running on Java 8, run the following command:

```bash
curl -i -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:9084/query/mutation/system/note' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"hostname": "system-java11","text": "I am trying out GraphQL on Open Liberty!"}'
```

You will recieve a `200` response code, similar to below, if the request is processed succesfully. 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en-US
Content-Length: 0
Date: Fri, 21 Apr 2023 14:17:47 GMT
```
endif::[]

You can see the note you added to the system service at the `GET /query/system/{hostname}` endpoint.

== Tearing down the environment

When you're done checking out the application, run the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--


== Testing the application

Although you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests. In this section, you'll create integration tests using Testcontainers to verify that the basic operations you implemented function correctly. 

First, create a RESTful client interface for the `query` microservice.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryResourceClient.java` interface.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceClient.java`
----

// file 0
QueryResourceClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceClient.java[]
----

This interface declares [hotspot=querySystem file=0]`querySystem()`, [hotspot=querySystemLoad file=0]`querySystemLoad()`, and [hotspot=editNote file=0]`editNote()` methods for accessing each of the endpoints that are set up to access the `query` microservice.

Create the test container class that accesses the `query` image that you built in previous section.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `LibertyContainer.java` file.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/LibertyContainer.java`
----

// file 1
LibertyContainer.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/LibertyContainer.java[]
----

The [hotspot=createRestClient file=1]`createRestClient()` method creates a REST client instance with the `QueryResourceClient` interface. The [hotspot=getBaseURL file=1]`getBaseURL()` method constructs the URL that can access the `query` image.

Now, create your integration test cases.

[role="code_command hotspot file=2" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryResourceIT.java` file.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceIT.java`
----

// file 2
QueryResourceIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResourceIT.java[]
----

Define the [hotspot=systemContainer file=2]`systemContainer` test container to start up the `system-java11` image, the [hotspot=graphqlContainer file=2]`graphqlContainer` test container to start up the `graphql` image, and the [hotspot=libertyContainer file=2]`libertyContainer` test container to start up the `query` image. Make sure that the containers use the same network.

The [hotspot=testcontainers file=2]`@Testcontainers` annotation finds all fields that are annotated with the [hotspot=container file=2]`@Container` annotation and calls their container lifecycle methods. The `static` function declaration on each container indicates that this container will be started only once before any test method is executed and stopped after the last test method is executed.

The [hotspot=testGetSystem file=2]`testGetSystem()` verifies the `/query/system/{hostname}` endpoint with `hostname` set to `system-java11`.

The [hotspot=testGetSystemLoad file=2]`testGetSystemLoad()` verifies the `/query/systemLoad/{hostnames}` endpoint with `hostnames` set to `system-java11`.

The [hotspot=testEditNote file=2]`testEditNote()` verifies the mutation operation at the `/query/mutation/system/note` endpoint.

// file 3
pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/pom.xml[]
----

The required [hotspot=testDependenies file=3]`dependencies` are already added to the [hotspot file=3]`pom.xml` Maven configuration file for you, including JUnit5, JBoss RESTEasy client, Glassfish JSON, Testcontainers, and Log4J libraries.

To enable running the integration test by the Maven `verify` goal, the [hotspot=failsafe file=3]`maven-failsafe-plugin` plugin is also required.

=== Running the tests

You can run the Maven `verify` goal, which compiles the java files, starts the containers, runs the tests, and then stops the containers.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-graphql-client/start/query
export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
mvn verify
```
endif::[]

You will see the following output:
